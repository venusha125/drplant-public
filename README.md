### What is Dr.Plant?

“Dr. Plant”, an intelligent plant disease detection system. In here you only needed
to take a photo of the part of a plant that you needed a guide to understand whether it is a disease
or not. And Dr. Plant will give you a pre-consultancy if it is a disease, how you should act in that
situation and what are the precautions you need to follow to save your plant.
